- Cited Guidance: For any domain based on the Findings general observation class,
    such as lab tests which are based on a specimen, the collection date is likely
    to be tied to when the specimen or source of the finding was captured, not necessarily
    when the data was recorded. in order to ensure that the critical timing information
    is always represented in the same variable, the --DTC variable is used to represent
    the time of specimen collection.

- Cited Guidance: While it would be possible to allow a value such as NONE or UNBOUNDED
    to be entered in TSVAL, validation programs would then have to recognize this
    special term as an exception to the expected data format. Therefore, it was decided
    that a separate null flavor variable that uses the ISO 21090 null flavor terminology
    would be a better solution.

- Cited Guidance: The variable TSVALNF is based on the idea of a "null flavor" as
    embodied in the ISO 21090 standard; "Health Informatics' Harmonized data types
    for information exchange." A null flavor is an ancillary piece of data that provides
    additional information when its primary piece of data is null (has a missing value).
    There is controlled terminology for the null flavor data item which includes such
    familiar values as Unknown; Other; and Not Applicable among its fourteen terms

    date/time of collection is reported in any domain, the date/time should go into
    the --DTC field (e.g., EGDTC for Date/Time of ECG). For any domain based on the
    Findings general observation class, such as lab tests which are based on a specimen,
    the collection date is likely to be tied to when the specimen or source of the
    finding was captured, not necessarily when the data was recorded. In order to
    ensure that the critical timing information is always represented in the same
    variable, the --DTC variable is used to represent the time of specimen collection.
    For example, in the LB domain the LBDTC variable would be used for all single-point
    blood collections or spot urine collections. For timed lab collections (e.g.,
    24-hour urine collections) the LBDTC variable would be used for the start date/time
    of the collection and LBENDTC for the end date/time of the collection. This approach
    will allow the single-point and interval collections to use the same date/time
    variables consistently across all datasets for the Findings general observation
