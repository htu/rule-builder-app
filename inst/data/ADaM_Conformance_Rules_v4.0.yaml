    that "within a parameter" means "within a parameter within a dataset."

    ADaM IG v1.3, Section 3.1.1, Item 6: In a pair of corresponding variables (e.g.,
    TRTP and TRTPN), the primary or most commonly used variable does not have the
    suffix or extension (i.e., N for numeric or C for character). The relevant suffix
    is used only on the name of the secondary member of the variable pair. For example,
    in the (TRTP, TRTPN) pair, the primary variable, TRTP, is character, but it is
    not named TRTPC. Similarly in the (APERIOD, APERIODC) pair, the primary variable,
    APERIOD, is numeric, but it is not named APERIODN. When a secondary variable is
    included in the dataset, then the primary variable must also be included. If both
    variables of a variable pair are present, there must be a one-to-one relationship
    between the values of the two variables, as described in Item 5 above.'
